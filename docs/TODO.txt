Known issues:
2. Windows cannot delete broken symlinks due to _stat implementation.
1. --no-format is only implemented for size and counts.
3. --human-readable is only implemented for timestamp 

ToDo:
-ADD restore overwrite/rename with R/r O/o N/n. uppercase is ALL, lowercase is singular.
-ADD restore option to restore parent directories if they no longer exist if permissible.
-Implement --human-readable for list
-Implement PID_LOCK in /word
-Implement environment variable for .config as well as default dir.
-Implement --jobs // For multithreading

Suggestions:
-Implement a temporary file that contains the previous list of files that were restored. 
	Can also be done by creating a new sql column 'restoration' values true/false. This will never be deleted unless if the restored files do not exist.
-Implement trash d --message 'text' | -m 'text'. for a column with a message attached per file.
-Implement trash r --all --exclude 'text'| -a -e 'text'. restore all but the excluded. #Note --sql would be a better alternative. 
-implement trash e --shred, shreds all or selected files instead of just using unlink().

End Goal:
Once completed the final project will be to create a helper daemon/service for:
- trash scheduled time erases,
- automatic validation of everything inside /trash directory 
- Desktop integration with every major OS. Starting with XDG Trash Spec.
- Has a config implemented
