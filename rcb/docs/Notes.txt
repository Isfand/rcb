NOTE: NTFS uses UTF16 for filenames not UTF8 like POSIX filesystems. filepath() defaults to wstring instead of string,
c_str changes behaviour on string and wstring. Returns normal const char* on string and wchar_t on wstring. filepath() on NTFS is wstring() by default.
std::println doesn't support wstring or wchar_t. Will require explicit use of .string().

NOTE: 'Unlike rm -rf', remove_all() doesn't recursively change permissions where needed, which can prevent file removals.

NOTE: Conditional reset for ID sequences:
	DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence
	WHERE name = 'rcb'
	AND NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT 1 FROM rcb LIMIT 1
	);

Note: relative_time example in sql:
WITH now_cte AS (
  SELECT strftime('%s','now') AS now
)
SELECT
  r.id,
  r.file,
  CASE
    WHEN (now_cte.now - r.timestamp) < 60 THEN 'just now'
    WHEN (now_cte.now - r.timestamp) < 3600 
      THEN ((now_cte.now - r.timestamp) / 60) || ' minutes ago'
    WHEN (now_cte.now - r.timestamp) < 86400 
      THEN ((now_cte.now - r.timestamp) / 3600) || ' hours ago'
    ELSE ((now_cte.now - r.timestamp) / 86400) || ' days ago'
  END AS relative_time
FROM rcb r
CROSS JOIN now_cte;

Note: When changing version, change version inside:
	rcb/common/globals.hxx
	docs/manual/man/*
	docs/manual/help/*
	manifest
	update docs/CHANGELOG.txt
	and pkg-managers/* && Also update distinfo/* with makesum

Note: To install use 'b install config.cxx.loptions="-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib" config.install.root="/usr/local/" config.install.sudo="sudo"'

Note: To override release config to static link in a non-glibc environment `bdep update @x64-posix-gcc-release config.bin.lib=static config.cxx="g++ -O2 -DNDEBUG -static" config.cxx.loptions="-s"` 

Note: To use system installed dependencies, use: "bdep sync ?sys:libsqlite3"
